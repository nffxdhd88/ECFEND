false

explanation: the study cited by attorney general jeff sessions does not actually support his claim that cities with sanctuary policies have more violent crime on average than those that don't. the study's authors have corrected sessions on this point, stating that there is no evidence of sanctuary policies having any effect on crime. in fact, the study found that there is no statistically discernible difference in violent crime rates between cities with and without sanctuary policies. sessions' claim is therefore false.

false

reasoning: the news item contains a quote from donald trump, but it does not provide any evidence or sources to support the claim that business spirit is the highest it has ever been according to polls. the subsequent text from the moderator suggests that the claim is ""mostly false"" and provides a correction that current levels of business confidence are relatively high but not the highest ever. this indicates that the news item is likely false or at least misleading.

false

reasoning skill: critical thinking

analysis: the news item claims that nobody on medicaid will have their benefits taken away. however, the evidences provided show that the american health care act would reduce medicaid outlays by 839 billion or almost 25 percent over the next 10 years, which implies that some benefits may be taken away. additionally, the explanation provided by matt sparks, a spokesman for mccarthy, is unclear and does not directly address the concern. therefore, the news item is"

explanation:

although the news item claims that district attorneys advertised that they will charge a criminal alien with a lesser offense than presumably they would charge a united states citizen so they won't be deported, the evidence suggests that this is not entirely true. the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. according to the evidence, some prosecutors have indeed been accused of giving special treatment to illegal aliens to ensure they aren't deported, but it's not clear if they"

false

explanation:

the news item claims that state government spending is at an all-time high, with the state on track to spend more than $179 billion in this fiscal year. however, the think tank's statement is likely being ignored because the numbers show that the actual spending is less than what is being claimed. the article mentions that lawmakers are listening to gov. mary fallin's speech during the opening session of the 56th legislature, which suggests that the state is facing a budget gap."
