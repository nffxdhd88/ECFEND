the news item appears to be a fragment of a fictional dialogue, likely from a movie or book. the characters and quotes mentioned, such as ""inigo montoya"", ""count rugen"", and ""vizzini"", are well-known from the movie ""the princess bride"". the language and style of the dialogue are also consistent with the tone and humor of the movie. therefore, it is likely that the news item is a fabrication or a joke, and not a genuine news"

false

explanation: the news item claims that president obama ""stole"" $500 billion from medicare to fund the affordable care act (obamacare). however, the facts suggest that the law actually reduces medicare spending by $500 billion over 10 years through a combination of higher medicare payroll taxes, reduced payments to healthcare providers, and other cost-saving measures. the law does not ""steal"" money from medicare, but rather attempts to curtail the rapid growth of medicare spending. therefore, the news"

2866	paul ryans medicare plan could raise future retirees costs 6000	true	false	"answer:

false

explanation: the news item is false because it relies on unverifiable claims made by the obama campaign and a commercial by the aarp, which are not supported by credible evidence. the congressional budget office report cited in the article actually shows that repealing the health care overhaul law would increase medicare spending by $716 billion, not decrease it. the article also misrepresents the ryan plan, which is designed to reduce medicare spending by providing a voucher program for future retirees, rather than raising costs"

explanation: although the news item presents some evidence from a credible source, pew research center, to support its claim, it is still false. the evidence presented is based on a 2016 survey, which might not reflect the current sentiment of the world towards president obama. moreover, the news item fails to provide a balanced view, as it does not mention any positive developments or achievements of the obama administration that might have contributed to its popularity abroad. a more nuanced analysis would be needed to determine"

the news item is false. the environmental protection agency (epa) proposal would raise gasoline prices by less than a penny per gallon, not 25 cents per gallon. the epa's proposal aims to reduce sulfur in gasoline and tighten auto emission standards, which would have a minimal impact on gasoline prices. the oil industry's study puts the cost between 6 and 9 cents per gallon, but this is still a far cry from the 25 cents per gallon claimed by newt gingrich. the epa"

reasoning: the news item is false because it is a compilation of unrelated events, quotes, and information that are not necessarily connected to the initial claim of newt gingrich being fined for ethics violations. the text includes multiple tangential statements and unsubstantiated claims, which makes it difficult to discern the accuracy of the information. the use of phrases like ""here are the facts that i took from a report"" and ""read it and then you decide"" suggests that the author is presenting a"

false

explanation: the news item is false because it claims that obama closed corporate tax loopholes that were sending profits overseas, which is not true. the evidence provided shows that obama's efforts to get this proposal enacted into law repeatedly died in congress. this means that he did not succeed in closing these loopholes. therefore, the news item is false.

false

reasoning skill: identifying pros and cons

analysis: the news item claims that the national labor relations board told boeing that they cannot build a factory in south carolina. however, the evidence provided shows that the nlra actually dropped the case and the focus of the complaint was not south carolina's law but rather boeing's alleged punishment of workers in another state for union activity. this suggests that the news item is false and that the nlra did not dictate where boeing could build its factory."

the given news item appears to be a mix of factual information and anecdotal evidence. while it is true that some airlines have introduced basic economy seats that strip away certain amenities, the statement that ""an idea that you can make money by giving something away is no longer radical"" is an unsubstantiated claim. the article relies on a single quote from bastian, which may not be representative of the entire airline industry. furthermore, the article does"
1284	eliminating obamacare saves 95 billion year	false	false	"answer:

false

reasoning skill: critical thinking, analyzing evidence, identifying bias

analysis: the news item is false because the statement ""eliminating obamacare saves 95 billion year"" is not supported by the provided evidence. the congressional budget office analysis of the gop's repeal bill only mentions that repealing the health care reform law would save money, but it does not provide a specific figure of 95 billion. furthermore, the statement is attributed to mitt romney, but the evidence provided is a"

reasoning: 
the news item claims that newt gingrich boasted about balancing the budget with the 1997 balanced budget act and having four consecutive balanced budgets. however, politifact rated the statement false, pointing out that two of the balanced budgets he claimed credit for passed after he had left the house. this suggests that gingrich's claim is not entirely accurate, and therefore the news item is false.

false

reasoning: the news item claims that the health care law includes a 38% sales tax on real estate transactions. however, the evidence suggests that the tax is actually a 38% tax on unearned income, including profits from the sale of real estate, and it only applies to certain individuals with high incomes from other sources. the tax does not apply to the first home sale for a personal residence or for a married couple, and it is not a sales tax on all real estate"
