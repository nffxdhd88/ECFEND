the news item is false.

reasoning skill: identifying pros and cons

analysis: the news item claims that the federal hate crimes prevention act bill would create special protection for pedophiles, which is a false claim. the bill does not protect pedophiles, as pedophilia is not considered a disability under current federal law, and the americans with disabilities act of 1990 specifically excludes pedophilia. the bill also does not create a federal slush fund for hate crime prevention programs, but"
